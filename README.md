# Wenderski-RNAseq-Analysis

Processing RNA-seq PE files sourced from the Crabtree Lab: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7211998/

The RNAseq dataset is downloaded from published PE RNA-seq files from GEO and processing them for QC, aligning and analysis in Rstudio. The analysis is setup to run on the DMCBH Alder computing cluster using bash scripts.
